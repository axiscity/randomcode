Please accept this letter as my notice of resignation from my position as a Software Engineer at BAE Systems. 

My last day of employment will be provisionally 08/04/20.

First off I would like to thank BAE for the opportunity you gave me to work on such an interesting project over the last year.

I’ve greatly appreciated the opportunities the project presented, and I’ve learned a great deal.

You have a great team an I will miss them and working with them.

I also apologise for any inconvenience this will cause.

I was approached out of the blue by another company which has an easier commute and they have made me an offer I really can’t refuse.

 I am disappointed I will not continuing to work with you. I will make every effort to make sure hand over of any work goes as smoothly as possible.


I would just like to thank you once again and I wish the team every success in the future with the project.

I do not doubt it will continue to be a success.

Thank you again and kind regards,
